**Java Shapes Calculator ** 
 This Repository contains a Java program designed as an educational resource to exemplify the utilization of interfaces and class inheritance within Java. The application facilitates the computation of area and perimeter for various shapes, notably Circles, Triangles, and Rectangles. It serves as a demonstration of implementing an interface and extending it through concrete classes, each corresponding to a distinct geometric shape.


The primary aim of the task is to elucidate the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), with a specific emphasis on interfaces and inheritance. Users are prompted to provide dimensions for each shape, following which the application computes and presents the respective area and perimeter based on the provided parameters.


Implementation of Interfaces: The Shape interface outlines methods for area and perimeter calculation, which are subsequently realized by the concrete shape classes.
Utilization of Class Inheritance: Concrete classes, including Circle, Triangle, and Rectangle, inherit and implement functionalities from the Shape interface, showcasing polymorphism.
User Interaction: The application interacts with users to acquire dimensions for shape calculation purposes.
Calculation Functionality: The application performs computations for both area and perimeter of each shape provided.
Code Organization
Shape Interface: Establishes the blueprint that all shape classes adhere to.
Circle Class: Implements the Shape interface, serving as a representation of a circle.
Triangle Class: Implements the Shape interface, representing a triangle.
Rectangle Class: Implements the Shape interface, symbolizing a rectangle.
Main Class: Incorporates the main method responsible for executing the application, illustrating the usage of shape classes and managing user inputs.
