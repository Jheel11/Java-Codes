**INTRODUCTION**
**This Java program separates even and odd numbers from a given list of integers.**
It consists of two classes:

**Part1_evenodd.java**: This class contains the main method to execute the program. It takes input from the user, processes the numbers, and displays the even and odd numbers separately.

**Input.java**: This class provides a method to take input from the user. The takeInput() method returns an array of integers entered by the user.

**Execution**
To run the program:

1)Compile both Part1_evenodd.java and Input.java.
2)Execute the Part1_evenodd class, which serves as the entry point to the program.
