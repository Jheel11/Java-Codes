**Introduction**
This Java program addresses the task of finding two neighboring numbers in an array with the smallest distance between them. The solution is implemented through the following classes:

**Main Class**
The Main class serves as the entry point to the program. It retrieves input from the user, computes the index of the first number with the smallest distance to its neighbor, and displays the result.

**NearestNeighbors Class**
The NearestNeighbors class contains the logic for finding two neighboring numbers in an array with the smallest distance between them. It provides the findNearest() method, which takes an array of integers as input and returns the index of the first number with the smallest distance to its neighbor.

**UserInput Class**
The UserInput class handles user input. It includes the takeInput() method, which prompts the user to enter the number of elements in the array and the elements themselves. It then returns an array containing the user-inputted numbers.

**Execution**
To execute the program:

1)Compile all Java files (Main.java, NearestNeighbors.java, and UserInput.java).
2)Run the Main class.
