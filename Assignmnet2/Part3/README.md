**Introduction**
This Java program addresses the task of converting an array into an ArrayList and vice versa. It includes the following classes:

**InputClass**
The InputClass provides functionality to obtain an array of integers from the user. It prompts the user to enter the number of elements in the array and then the elements themselves. The getArrayFromUser() method returns the user-inputted array.

**MainClass**
The MainClass serves as the entry point to the program. It retrieves an array from the user using the InputClass, converts the array to an ArrayList using methods from the ConversionClass, and then converts the ArrayList back to an array. It displays the results of both conversions.

**ConversionClass**  
The ConversionClass contains static methods for converting an array to an ArrayList (arrayToArrayList()) and converting an ArrayList to an array (arrayListToArray()).

**Execution**
To execute the program:

Compile all Java files (MainClass.java, InputClass.java, and ConversionClass.java).
Run the MainClass class.
